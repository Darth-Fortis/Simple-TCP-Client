# Simple-TCP-Client

This is a simple TCP client whch you can adapt to you needs:)
By default I set the target_host to 'www.google.com', target_port to 80 and a HTTP GET request for the root path ("/") sent to the server with the host "google.com" using the HTTP/1.1 protocol.

Feel free to change these variables and I hope this helped:)
